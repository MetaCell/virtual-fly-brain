# Environment-based API URL configuration
# The VITE_API_URL is now dynamically set in vite.config.js:
# - In development: uses https://vfb.dev.metacell.us
# - In production: uses VFB_DOMAIN environment variable from Dockerfile
# Note: This file can be left empty or used for other environment variables
